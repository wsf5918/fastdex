    For most people, the word "fashion" means "clothes". But people may ask the question,"What __1__ are in fashion?" And they use the adjective "fashionable" in the same way:"She was wearing a __2__ coat." "His shirt was really a fashionable color."
    But of course there are fashions __3__ many things, not only in clothes. There are fashions in holidays, in restaurants, in films and books. There are __4__ fashions in school subjects, jobs...and in languages. Fashions __5__ as time goes. 
    If you look at pictures of people or things from the past, you will see that fashions have always changed. An English house of 1750 was different from one of 1650. A fashionable man in 1780 looked very different from his grandson in 1850.
