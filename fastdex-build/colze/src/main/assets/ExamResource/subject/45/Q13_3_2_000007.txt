    English names and Chinese names are quite different in some __1__ ways. But it's not hard for us to know.
    Unlike Chinese, most English people have __2__ names. One is their family name, both of the other names are given names. Their family name is __3__ the given name. They use Mr, Mrs or Miss with the __4__ name. but they never use __5__ with the first name. For example, we can __6__ a man named James Allan Green Mr. Green, __7__ we can't call him Mr. James or Mr. Allan. People usually use Jim __8__ James. Jim is short for James because it's __9__ to remember. 
    But Chinese names are the opposite. A girl with the name Han Limei __10__ her family name Han first. Of course, she can be called Ah Mei for short in China if you wish.
